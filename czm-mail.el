;;; Commentary:

;; A hodgepodge of mail-related functions and tweaks.

;; 1. `czm-mail-message-tab' gives smarter tab completion in message
;; composition buffers -- inserting aliases in header files, and
;; otherwise calling `message-tab'.

;; 2. `rmail-header-summary' is overrided to allow for longer sender
;; names and, for messages sent by us, to show their recipients.

;; 3. `read-file-name' is advised so that when `rmail' is called with
;; a prefix argument, it reads from `rmail-secondary-file-directory'.

;; 4. A command `czm-mail-mailrc-add-entry' for storing email aliases,
;; adapted from Dimitri Fontaine's blog:
;; https://tapoueh.org/blog/2009/09/improving-~-.mailrc-usage/).

;; 5. A command `czm-mail-refile-and-store-link' for refiling and
;; storing links in some specified target rmail file.

;; Sample config:

;; (keymap-set message-mode-map "TAB" #'czm-mail-message-tab)
;; (setopt czm-mail-refile-file "~/mail/scheduled.rmail")
;; (keymap-set rmail-mode-map "S" #'czm-mail-refile-and-store-link)
;; (keymap-global-set "C-c C-@" #'czm-mail-mailrc-add-entry)
;; (czm-mail-setup)
;;
;; or, with use-package:
;;
;; (use-package czm-mail
;;   :after rmail
;;   :bind
;;   ("C-c C-@" . czm-mail-mailrc-add-entry)
;;   (:map rmail-mode-map
;;         ("S" . czm-mail-refile-and-store-link))
;;   (:map message-mode-map
;;         ("TAB" . czm-mail-message-tab)
;;         ("C-c C-a" . czm-mail-insert-diff-as-attachment))
